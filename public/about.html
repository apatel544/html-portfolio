<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Ankur Patel, a software engineer originally from Charlotte, NC. I studied Computer Science at UNC Charlotte, where I developed a passion for building scalable and user-friendly applications. After gaining over five years of experience in the industry, I recently moved to Los Angeles, where I'm excited to explore new opportunities. I specialize in technologies like React.js, C#, and .NET, and I've worked on global site development, application rebuilding, and automation. I'm always eager to learn, grow, and contribute to impactful projects.</p>
